### Findings

1. Sales by Age Group:

- Middle Age customers(35-54) are the only age group where more customers purchase bikes than not, regardless of gender, location, or marital status.
- Young Adults(18-34) purchase more bikes than Seniors(55+).

2. Sales by Gender:

- Men purchase more bikes than women in every region except Europe.
- Married men purchase substantially more bikes than married women.
- Single women purchase substantially more bikes than single men.
  
3. Sales by Region:

- People who commute 0-1 miles purchase the most bikes in every region except North America, where 2-5 miles is the most popular.
- The Pacific is the only region where customers in the Young Adults group(18-34) purchase more bikes than not.
- Europe is the only region where women purchase more bikes than men.
  
4. Sales by Education Level:
- Customers with Bachelors degrees purchase more bikes than any other education level.

### Recommendations
1. Targeted Marketing for Middle Age Customers:
- Develop targeted marketing campaigns focusing on Middle Age customers (35-54), as they are the most likely to purchase bikes. Use age-appropriate messaging and channels that resonate with this demographic.

2. Promote to Young Adults in the Pacific Region:
- Increase marketing efforts targeting Young Adults (18-34) in the Pacific region, as they are more likely to purchase bikes there. Highlight features that appeal to younger customers, such as trendy designs and social media campaigns.

3. Utilize Marital Status Insights:
- For married men, emphasize bikes as a family-friendly activity or stress-relief tool.
- For single women, promote bikes as a means of social activity, independence, and fitness.

4. Region-Specific Commuting Promotions:
- In regions where short-distance commuting (0-1 miles) is popular, create campaigns highlighting the convenience and efficiency of biking for short commutes. In North America, where 2-5 miles is the norm, emphasize the fitness benefits, time savings and gas savings of biking over driving.


### Findings

1. Invoices by Country:

- The United States has the highest number of invoices (91), followed by Canada (56), France (35), and Brazil (35).

2. Invoices by Quarter:

- Sales are consistent each quarter and each year from 2009 to 2013.
- Among the three sales agents (Jane Peacock, Margaret Park, and Steve Johnson), Steve Johnson has never had the highest sales in any quarter during these years.

3. Sales by Agent:

- The rankings in total sales for the years 2009-2013 are as follows:
  1. Jane Peacock: 146
  2. Margaret Park: 140
  3. Steve Johnson: 126

4. Sales by Genre:

- The most popular genres by sales are Rock (835), Latin (386), Metal (264), and Alternative & Punk (244).
- There is a significant drop-off after these top genres, with Jazz (80), Blues (61), TV Shows (47), Classical (41), and R&B/Soul (41) having much lower sales.

### Recommendations
1. Country-Specific Marketing Strategies:
- Focus on Top Markets: Since the US, Canada, France, and Brazil are the top markets, consider tailoring marketing strategies and promotions specifically for these countries to further boost sales.
- Explore Growth Opportunities: Identify and target other potential markets by analyzing customer demographics and preferences in countries with fewer invoices.

2. Sales Agent Performance Improvement:
- Training and Development: Provide additional training and development opportunities for Steve Johnson to help improve his sales performance. Analyzing his sales techniques and customer interactions might reveal areas for improvement.
- Performance Incentives: Implement performance-based incentives to motivate all sales agents, fostering a competitive environment that could boost overall sales.

3. Genre-Based Sales Strategies:
- Promote Popular Genres: Increase promotions for top-selling genres like Rock, Latin, Metal, and Alternative & Punk to capitalize on their popularity.

4. Diversify Offerings: Consider expanding the catalog and marketing efforts for underperforming genres such as Jazz, Blues, TV Shows, Classical, and R&B/Soul to attract a more diverse customer base.

5. Consistent Sales Patterns:
Seasonal Promotions:
- Since sales are consistent each quarter, introducing seasonal promotions or special offers during low sales periods can help maintain or boost sales throughout the year.
Sales Forecasting:
- Use the consistent sales data to improve sales forecasting and inventory management, ensuring that popular items are always in stock.

### Steps Taken

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**: The dataset was imported into SQLite for initial data exploration and cleaning.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various SQL queries were executed to explore the dataset.
3. **Visualization**: The cleaned data was imported into Tableau for visualization.

### Tools and Technologies

- **SQLite**: Used for data import, cleaning, and executing SQL queries.
- **Tableau**: Employed for creating visualizations and building an interactive dashboard.

### Repository Contents

- **Data**: The raw and cleaned dataset.
- **SQL Scripts**: Scripts used for data cleaning and exploratory analysis.
- **Tableau Workbook**: The workbook containing all visualizations and the dashboard.

### Findings

1. Invoices by Country:

- The United States has the highest number of invoices (91), followed by Canada (56), France (35), and Brazil (35).

2. Invoices by Quarter:

- Sales are consistent each quarter and each year from 2009 to 2013.
- Among the three sales agents (Jane Peacock, Margaret Park, and Steve Johnson), Steve Johnson has never had the highest sales in any quarter during these years.

3. Sales by Agent:

- The rankings in total sales for the years 2009-2013 are as follows:
  1. Jane Peacock: 146
  2. Margaret Park: 140
  3. Steve Johnson: 126

4. Sales by Genre:

- The most popular genres by sales are Rock (835), Latin (386), Metal (264), and Alternative & Punk (244).
- There is a significant drop-off after these top genres, with Jazz (80), Blues (61), TV Shows (47), Classical (41), and R&B/Soul (41) etc. having much lower sales.

### Recommendations
1. Country-Specific Marketing Strategies:
- Focus on Top Markets: Since the US, Canada, France, and Brazil are the top markets, consider tailoring marketing strategies and promotions specifically for these countries to further boost sales.
- Explore Growth Opportunities: Identify and target other potential markets by analyzing customer demographics and preferences in countries with fewer invoices.

2. Sales Agent Performance Improvement:
- Training and Development: Provide additional training and development opportunities for Steve Johnson to help improve his sales performance. Analyzing his sales techniques and customer interactions might reveal areas for improvement.
- Performance Incentives: Implement performance-based incentives to motivate all sales agents, fostering a competitive environment that could boost overall sales.

3. Genre-Based Sales Strategies:
- Promote Popular Genres: Increase promotions for top-selling genres like Rock, Latin, Metal, and Alternative & Punk to capitalize on their popularity.
- Expand Marketing Efforts: Consider expanding the catalog and marketing efforts for underperforming genres such as Jazz, Blues, TV Shows, Classical, and R&B/Soul to attract a more diverse customer base.

5. Consistent Sales Patterns:
Seasonal Promotions:
- Since sales are consistent each quarter, introducing seasonal promotions or special offers during low sales periods can help maintain or boost sales throughout the year.
Sales Forecasting:
- Use the consistent sales data to improve sales forecasting and inventory management, ensuring that popular items are always in stock.
